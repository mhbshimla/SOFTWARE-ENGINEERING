*README: Hospital Management System*

# üè• Hospital Management System

The *Hospital Management System* is a full-stack web application built using PHP and MySQL. It is designed to simplify and automate common hospital operations, such as patient registration, appointment booking, doctor management, and administrative oversight. The goal is to deliver an efficient digital platform where multiple roles (patients, doctors, and administrators) can perform their respective actions through a single interface. This system aims to reduce manual errors, save time, and improve communication between patients and hospital staff.

This project supports:

- Patient account creation and appointment booking
- Doctor registration and appointment viewing
- Department-wise doctor listing
- Admin control panel to manage doctors and user messages
- Role-based access for patient, doctor, and admin
